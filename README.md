1. **Star Selection**: Select blocks for each category; selection order is recorded
2. **Phase 1**: Legend + entity cards generation
3. **Phase 2**: World map, analysis (timeline, symbols, conflicts, themes, social code), and ancient language completion
4. **Loading/Logo**: The same constellation is redrawn and results appear on screen
5. **Recovery System**: Smart recovery for broken JSON, fidelity validation to detect missing motifs

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run typecheck
